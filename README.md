# 2019 My Year Lyrics
[Intro]
Uh, uh, one, uh
New watch, one of one
Uh, uh, uh, one, uh, ayy

[Chorus]
Foreign in the garage cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock
Foreign in the garage, cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock

[Verse 1]
On her knees, uh
6-6-6, uh, I got success
I just fucked a evil bitch
I made three nines out her sixes
Now she positively give me top on the mattress
I try to keep it as positive as possible
But it be hard when your back's against the wall
And the demons on your phone interrupting all your calls (Yeah, yeah-yeah)
It be hard when your back's against the wall
And the demons on your phone interrupting all your calls

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't panic, outta anything you do, don't panic, oh
Don't panic, outta anything you do, don't panic, just manage

[Chorus]
Foreign in the garage, cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock
Foreign in the garage, cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock

[Verse 2]
I'm gon' shut the fuck up (Why?), and let my watch talk
I'm gon' shut the fuck up (Why?), and let my naughts talk
I'm gon' shut the fuck up (Let's go), I'ma let my Glock talk
They cook me beats then bring 'em
I just sprinkle on a little hot sauce
2019 my year, oh yeah, oh yeah, best believe
I achieved so much this year
One of the greatest you ever seen do it
Double G on my raincoat, but it's rainin' in L.A
So I ain't have to go wash my Range Rove'
I get high off percocet and lean, it ain't no hangover

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't panic, outta anything you do, don't panic, oh
Don't panic, outta anything you do, don't panic, just manage

[Chorus]
Foreign in the garage, cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock
Foreign in the garage, cost a hundon, engine, vroom-vroom
New watch, one of one-one, a baguette clock, AP tick-tock
